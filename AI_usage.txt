These are the main prompts used to help create this data visualization. Most outputs were altered for accuracy and specificity. 

1. Use create react app to create a barebones webpage with a title and main area to store tree icons.

2. Explain how to use papaparse to gather data from a CSV file.

3. Given that you have the variables count, height, spread, species, and common name, generate processed tree data that includes
average height, spread, species count and the most common name

4. Creat an html element to use as an icon for trees. Make it artsy and I want variables that can be changed later for size and 
color. Also add a isHighlighted variable to know when the tree is hovered over.

5. Given this code, render a UI that looks simplistic. Add functionality for searching and sorting by different variables. I want 
each tree icon to represent a different genus and the size of each icon to be proportional to the average height of that genus.
The color intensity should indicate the population, and the hover effect should make the info panel pop up with data about that 
tree.
